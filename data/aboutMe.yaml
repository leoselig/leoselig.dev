  ## Professionally

    I love problem solving. Diving deep into complex problems, discussing ideas with others and ultimately finding a proper solution is pure joy for me. Aside from that, I relish coding: turning an idea into pixels or seeing my tests turn green is a gift that keeps on giving.

    My communication-style is best described as open, empathetic and with dose of humor. Hence, I'm striving for a good atomsphere within a team so that everyone can feel encouraged to raise concerns or, generally, voice their opinions.


  ## Personally

  The things I enjoy:
    - X🧗‍♂️  riding my bike to the next boulder gym
    - X🎭  rhetorics and acting
    - X🐣  playing with my child
    - X🎲  board games
