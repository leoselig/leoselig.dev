  # Me, professionally

  During my work I will strike the balance between an analytical and a hands-on approach. I will ask questions until I understood the objective and then work on the solution.

  When working on a task on my own, I prefer focused work with few interuptions and will make sure to give valuable updates on my work status along the way.

  My communication-style can be described as open with a dose of humor. I prefer connecting with the people I'm working with to some degree and believe that this is the basis for openly giving my opinion, raising questions or bringing up possible issues.

  # Me, personally

  I'm a passionate 🏃‍♂️ runner & boulderer 🧗‍♂️ and my favorite mean of transport is my bike.

  In the past, I spent quite some years as a semi-professional actor and while I'm lacking opportunities to keep doing so at the moment, I still have it in my heart.
